```bash
git clone https://github.com/GhostActive/practical-shell-for-pentesting.git
```
2. Goto subfolder `utils/` and set executable flag

```bash
sudo cp filename project /usr/local/bin/
```

**Installation - Only for script *Item 2: project***

The script *project* requires the definition of the following values as global environment variables:

Bash - Append the following variable definitions to `~/.bashrc`. Reload the modified configuration file with command `source` or close and open new shell to make variables available.
```bash
# Root folder to store projects - Use an existing directory of your choice, e.g.
export PROJECTS_PATH ~/Projects
 
# Reference to current project folder
export CURRENT $PROJECTS_PATH/current
 
# Reference to current project's output folder 
export OUTPUT $PROJECTS_PATH/current/out

# Template folder used for initiating new project folder
export PROJECT_TEMPLATE $PROJECTS_PATH/template
```

Fish - Append the following variable definitions to `~/.config/config.fish`. Reload the modified configuration file with command `source` or close and open new shell to make variables available.
```bash
# Root folder to store projects - Use an existing directory of your choice, e.g.
set -Ux PROJECTS_PATH ~/Projects
 
# Reference to current project folder
set -Ux PROJECT $PROJECTS_PATH/current
 
# Reference to current project's output folder 
set -Ux OUTPUT $PROJECTS_PATH/current/out

# Template folder used for initiating new project folder
set -Ux PROJECT_TEMPLATE $PROJECTS_PATH/template
```

## Item 1: filename

```
$ filename --help

filename - Converts a list of string arguments containing special
           characters to a proper filename.

Usage: filename STRING...

Description:
    Converts a list of arguments containing special characters to a proper
    filename. Spaces and special characters are replaced by character '-'.
    Strings containing multiple times '-', like '--' or '---', are
    reduced to single '-'.

Examples:
    # Converting URL
    $ filename http://localhost:8080
    http-localhost-8080

    # Converting filename
    $ filename README.txt
    README-txt

    # Converting multiple input
    $ filename this is a hello world string
    this-is-a-hello-world-string
```

## Item 2: project

```
$ ./project --help

project - Creates new project folder

Usage: project [String...]

Options:
    -h, --help      Print this help message

Description
    Creates a new project folder in directory $PROJECTS_PATH.
    For correct use the following environment variables must
    be defined:
        - PROJECTS_PATH   Root folder to store projects
        - PROJECT         Reference to current project folder
                          in $PROJECTS_PATH
        - OUTPUT          Reference to output folder in $PROJECT

    While creating a new project folder the symbolic link defined by
    $PROJECT is updated to the new project folder. Furthermore, the
    folder $OUTPUT is created. Each new project gets a prefix containing
    the date of creation.

    Optionally, a template folder $PROJECT_TEMPLATE can be defined.
    The content of the template folder is copied to new project folder
    during the creation process.

    Sample - Definition of variables in .bashrc:
        export PROJECTS_PATH ~/Projects
        export PROJECT $PROJECTS_PATH/current
        export OUTPUT $PROJECTS_PATH/current/out
        export PROJECT_TEMPLATE $PROJECTS_PATH/template

Examples:
    # Show current configuration
    project

    # Create new project folder
    project samplecustomer sampleproject


```
