| [project-status](https://github.com/GhostActive/effective-shell-for-pentesting/blob/main/utils/project-status) | Show  the current values of project's environment variables. |

For more information and examples, please see the scripts containing a more detailed description. 

> **Hint:** The project-* scripts requires the definition of global environment variables like shown "Step 1: Defition of Global Environment Variables" (section "Preperation").


 
## Preparation

The following section contains required steps to setup the shell configuration. Choose the specified configuration depending on your shell. If your shell is not included, please customize the shown variables and aliases to your shell.

**Step 1: Defition of Global Environment Variables**

bash - Append the following variable definition to *~/.bashrc*
```bash
# Root folder to store projects - Use an existing directory of your choice, e.g.
export PROJECTS_PATH ~/Projects
 
# Reference to current project folder
export CURRENT $PROJECTS_PATH/current
 
# Reference to current project's output folder 
export OUTPUT $PROJECTS_PATH/current/out
```

fish - Append the following variable definitions to *~/.config/config.fish*
```bash
# Root folder to store projects - Use an existing directory of your choice, e.g.
set -Ux PROJECTS_PATH ~/Projects
 
# Reference to current project folder
set -Ux CURRENT $PROJECTS_PATH/current
 
# Reference to current project's output folder 
set -Ux OUTPUT $PROJECTS_PATH/current/out
```

**Step 2: Definition of Aliases**

bash and fish - Append the following alias definition to *~/.bashrc* or *~/.config/config.fish*
```bash
# Returns the current timestamp
alias now='date +"%F-%H%M%S-%Z"'
```
Sample
```
$ now
2021-06-30-115300-CEST
```

**Step 3: Install Required Scripts**

Choose a directory and clone git repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GhostActive/effective-shell-for-pentesting.git
```
Goto subfolder `utils/` and copy scripts to local filesystem
```bash
cd effective-shell-for-pentesting/utils/
sudo cp filename project-create project-status /usr/local/bin/
```
