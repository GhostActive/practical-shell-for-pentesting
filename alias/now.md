### now

Print current timestamp in format `yyyy-mm-dd-HHMMSS-Timezone`
```
alias now='date +"%F-%H%M%S-%Z"'
```
**Sample** - Write tool's raw output to file containing the current timestamp in name
```
$ now
2021-12-19-120350-EST
$ sslscan https://example.com | tee sslscan_example-com_$(now).txt
...
$ ls
sslscan_example-com_2021-12-19-120928-EST.txt
```
> Note that using the current timestamp in filename (e.g. as suffix) also prevents overwriting accidentally previous output files with same name.
