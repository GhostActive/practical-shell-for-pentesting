wordlist-diff - Prints all elements not in a word list in comparision to further
                ones.

Usage: wordlist-diff FILE FILE [FILE...]

Options:
    -h      Print this help message

Description:
    Determines the delta between a word list and other given ones. The delta is
    found by answering the question 'What elements are in the other lists that
    are not in the first list?' At least, the script expects two input files.

    The script is intended to support the process of extending own word lists.

    HINT: To work properly all files should have the same encoding and
          definition of line endings.

          For example, before processing, the files can be edited by 'dos2unix'
          command.

Example:
    # Get all elements not in first.txt, but in other ones
    wordlist-diff first.txt second.txt third.txt other.txt

```
