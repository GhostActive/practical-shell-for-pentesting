Description
    Creates a new project folder in directory $PROJECTS_PATH. For correct use
    the following environment variables must be defined:
        - PROJECTS_PATH   Root folder to store projects
        - PROJECT         Reference to current project folder
                          in $PROJECTS_PATH/
        - OUTPUT          Reference to output folder in $PROJECT/

    While creating a new project folder the symbolic link defined by $PROJECT
    is updated to new one. Furthermore, the folder $OUTPUT is created. Each new
    project gets a prefix containing the date of creation.

    Optionally, a template folder $PROJECT_TEMPLATE can be defined. The content
    of the template folder is copied to new project folder during the creation
    process.

    Sample - Definition of variables in .bashrc:
        export PROJECTS_PATH ~/Projects
        export PROJECT $PROJECTS_PATH/current
        export OUTPUT $PROJECTS_PATH/current/out
        export PROJECT_TEMPLATE $PROJECTS_PATH/template

Examples:
    # Show current configuration
    project

    # Create new project folder
    project samplecustomer sampleproject
