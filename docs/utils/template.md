### template

```
$ template -h

template - Replaces placeholders from given template.

Usage: template [-e|-s] (-|FILE) [KEY=VALUE...]

Options:
    -e      Enables post-editing mode and opens configured $EDITOR while
            processing
    -h      Print this help message
    -s      Enables show mode listing all placeholders found in template

Description:
    The script replaces placeholder with format '{{ NAME }}' in a given
    template.

    Input:  Two different input types are supported: Reading from stdin (-) and
            from file (FILE). Depending on the input type, the script expects
            '-' or an existing FILE.

    Mode:   By the flags -s (show mode) and -e (edit mode) the behaviour can be
            controlled. In show mode the script only reads the template,
            extracts the placeholders and prints them out. In editing mode,
            after replacing the placeholders the configured text editor is
            opened for further processing.

    Values: Any number of key-value pairs can be passed. The key name must
            corresponds to the name of the placeholder (case sensitive). If not
            all placeholders from the template are specified in argument list,
            they will be skipped and printed to output without further
            modification. Keys and values are separated by '=', for example
            'name=Joe'.

    HINT: The used text editor is defined as global environment variable
          $EDITOR. It should be checked that the used editor does not write
          (logging) messages to stdout or stderr during the process. Because the
          output of this script is also written to stdout - in bad case mixing
          with tool's output. Furthermore, the name of created temporary file,
          loaded to text editor, should not be changed. Otherwise the changes
          from text editor are not applied. After finishing editing, the file
          must be saved and the text editor closed.

Examples:
    # Read template from stdin
    echo '{{ message }}' | template - message='Hello World'

    # Read template from file and open with text editor
    template -e input.txt message='Hello World' name=Joe age=42

    # Read template and show placeholder
    template -s input.txt
