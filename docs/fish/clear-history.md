Usage: clear-history [FILE]...

Description:
    Deletes the fish history and prefills it with given files.
    Files for prefilling must have a valid fish history format.

    HINT: As the content of the history file is deleted, it may
          be useful to create a backup of the original one before
          starting the script, e.g.:

          cp ~/.local/share/fish/fish_history ~/history.bak

    HINT: Make sure that no other shell sessions are running
          during execution.

Examples:
    # Delete fish history
    clear-history

    # Delete fish history and prefill with prepared commands
    clear-history prepared-admin-cmd.txt prepared-dev-cmd.txt
