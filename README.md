## Introduction

The following guide isn't intended to copy and paste only the content, but containing general principles and recipes to improve ones shell skills as well as to provide new ideas. The use of the presented items strongly depends on the experience in dealing with shells. 

If you're unfamiliar with Linux systems and the use of a shell, have a look at the [*LPIC Learning Materials*](https://learning.lpi.org/en/learning-materials/learning-materials/).

## Overview

Typically, the following two shells are preinstalled on Linux systems:

* [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
* [zsh](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/)

Besides the two mentioned, there are of course several more, including my personal favorite

* [fish](https://fishshell.com/)

Note that in following `bash` and `fish` are supported preferentially.

## Tools

* [Terminator](https://terminator-gtk3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - Terminual emulator including grid view for multiple terminals
