## Installation

Clone repository (Skip this step if already done)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GhostActive/practical-shell-for-pentesting.git
```

**Install Aliases**

1. Copy and paste the aliases to your current shell configuration file - `~/.bashrc` (bash), `~/.zshrc` (zsh) or `~/.config/config.fish` (fish)
```bash
alias filter='grep -vP "^[ \t]*(#|\$)"'
alias now='date +"%F-%H%M%S-%Z"'
```
2. Reload the modified configuration file. e.g. with command `source`, or close and re-open a new shell to make the aliases available.

**Install Executables**

Within this repository the `install.sh` script can be used to install the provided scripts. The script copies and pastes the content from folder `fish/` and `utils/` to coresponding folders in the local filesystem. By default the items from

* `fish/` are installed to `~/.config/fish/functions/` and scripts from
* `utils/*` are installed to `/usr/local/bin/`.

> **Hint:** Make sure not to run the script as root (in combination with `sudo`), because `~/.config/...` is then dereferenced to `/root/.config/...` instead of the current user's home directory. Nevertheless, at runtime the script will prompt a `sudo` login for copying content to system folder `/usr/local/bin/`.

To use the script goto folder `practical-shell-for-pentesting/`, set the executable flag for install script initially and run it in normal user mode.

```bash
cd practical-shell-for-pentesting/ && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

> **Note** that fish functions are only installed, if the fish shell is installed. Furthermore, to invoke `utils/` scripts in shell globally, they are copied to `/usr/local/bin/`. Make sure that this folder is defined in the environment `$PATH` variable.

## Setup Environment Variables

Some of the scripts requires the definition of special environment variables to work.

**Setup for *project***

For bash  and zsh - Append the following variables to `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`. Reload the modified configuration file with command `source` or close and re-open new shell to make variables available.
```bash
# Root folder to store projects - Use an existing directory of your choice, e.g.
export PROJECTS_PATH ~/Projects
 
# Reference to current project folder
export PROJECT $PROJECTS_PATH/current
 
# Reference to current project's output folder 
export OUTPUT $PROJECTS_PATH/current/out

# Template folder used for initiating new project folder
export PROJECT_TEMPLATE $PROJECTS_PATH/template
```

For fish - Append the following variables to `~/.config/config.fish`. Reload the modified configuration file with command `source` or close and re-open new shell to make variables available.
```bash
# Root folder to store projects - Use an existing directory of your choice, e.g.
set -Ux PROJECTS_PATH ~/Projects
 
# Reference to current project folder
set -Ux PROJECT $PROJECTS_PATH/current
 
# Reference to current project's output folder 
set -Ux OUTPUT $PROJECTS_PATH/current/out

# Template folder used for initiating new project folder
set -Ux PROJECT_TEMPLATE $PROJECTS_PATH/template
```

**Setup for *template***

For the processing of templates in edit mode the global environment variable `$EDITOR` is used. Check if variable is set:
```bash
echo $EDITOR
```
If no executable is defined, for example, possible editors are `nano` or `vim`.

## Updates

For updating the items, just goto folder `practical-shell-for-pentesting/` and pull (`git pull`) available changes. 

* If changes are in "Aliases", than copy and paste the changes to shell config.
* If changes are in "Executables", than re-run the `install.sh` script.
