## Principles

### Item 1: KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid

### Item 2: Everything is a file.

### Item 3: DRY - Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself

## Recipes

### Item 1: Use Shortcuts

Shells usually have a set of shortcuts that allow to perform operations within an interactive shell quickly. For example instead of typing `clear` the shortcut `Ctrl`+`L` will clean the screen (works for bash and fish).

For `bash` you can find shortcuts in chapter [Command-Line-Editing](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Command-Line-Editing) within the official documentation. Furthermore, the `bash` supports a feature called [bash bang](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/bash-bang-commands) allowing to access commands and parameters from history. 

Sample - Repeat the last command with `sudo` permissions
```
$ cp filename /usr/local/bin/filename
cp: cannot create regular file '/usr/local/bin/filename': Permission denied
$ sudo !!
sudo cp filename /usr/local/bin/filename
[sudo] password for joe: 
```

The `fish` shell also offers a lot of functionality via shortcuts, for example, `ALT` + `H` to open the manual page of current command - if a man page exists - or `Alt` + `S` for appending `sudo` at the beginning of current command line. A full list of provided shortcuts can be found [here](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/interactive.html#shared-bindings).

> Hint: Maybe you must turn off `ALT` key to activate menu bar in settings of the terminal emulator.

### Item 2: Multiple Commands

Certain commands always occur, or at least frequently occur, in combination. Some practical examples for the start:

Sample 1: Editing shell settings - Requires reload to enable recent changes. After exiting vim editor the changes are loaded immediately.
```bash
vim ~/.config/fish/config.fish; source ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

Sample 2: Command cascade to push recent changes in git repository.
```bash
git add --all; git commit -m "<Commit Message>"; git push
```

Several commands can be concatenated by ";". The shell will run them independently of the return value in the given order from left to right.

Sample 3: Check if folder exists and print message if folder exists
```bash
$ test -d /tmp && echo "Folder exists"
Folder exists
$ test -d /test && echo "Folder exists"
[Empty Output]
```
A well-known example of combining commands with logical operators is updating software packages.

Sample 3: Update software packages - `apt upgrade` is only performed, if `apt update` was finishing successfull
```
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
...
```

It also has the advantage that commands occur together in the shell history. 

### Item 3: Use Aliases


### Item 4: Use Environment Variables


### Item 5: Prefill Shell History

```
$ cat commands.txt
vim ~/.bashrc; source ~/.bashrc
$ cp commands.txt ~/.bash_history
```

### Item 6: Write Scripts



### Item 7: Define Functions for Shell Operations
